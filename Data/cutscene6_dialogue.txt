Fire Commander: So this is the kid you've been telling me about.
Village Elder: Yes, % shows true promise.
Fire Commander: You speak the truth - % has reunited the Fire Nation
with the Dragon Blade. What is your name?
@: @, sir!
Fire Commander: Well done, @. How would you like a chance to prove yourself
worthy of the Ember Guard? You would be the youngest person in history to
join the Fire Nation's most elite military branch.
@: It would be a great honor, sir!
Fire Commander: To begin, you must learn to control the element of fire.
Try casting a few fireballs to demonstrate your strength.
@: Hey, I bet if I press r, I will shoot a fireball!
