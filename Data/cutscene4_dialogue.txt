Village Elder: Great job with the firewood! Ok now I have a real job for you.
@: As opposed to what kind of job...
Village Elder: I have heard rumors of an ancient fire relic in the woods to
the east. There have been reports of a sword, but not just any sword;
The last remaining sword to be crafted from dragon's breath, from our
honorable nation's ancestors.
@: Awesome! I'm going to go check it out!
