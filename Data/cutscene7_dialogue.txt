Fire Commander: Excellent job @, now for your first real mission. 
The Air Nation has allied themselves with the Earth Nation to try and steal 
the Dragon Blade from its rightful owners. Those pests know that they cannot 
meet us head-on, so they are raiding our caravans south of here. I need you 
to protect our caravans and make sure that they reach their destinations!
@: I will not let you down, sir!
Fire Commander: Excellent.
