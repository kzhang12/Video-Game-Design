Mom: Do you remember how you felt when it was your time?
Dad: It was over twenty years ago, but I'll never forget the day that
I was chosen to join the Fire Nation.
Mom: Neither will I. It was the proudest moment of my life.
Dad: As it was mine. Where is @? 
% was supposed to meet us back at the
house over an hour ago to prepare for this moment!
Mom: I think %'s still up in the animal pen feeding the sheep.
Dad: Well I hope % comes back soon.
