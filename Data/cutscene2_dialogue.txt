Mom: @! Thank god you're finally back! We were starting to worry!
Dad: I can see that you're nervous for your big day. Why don't you
go and visit the village elder, and see if he has any
words of wisdom for you. Do you remember where he lives? He's in
the isolated house north-west of here. Just follow the path.
